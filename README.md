# Instructions
Run `main.m`

Controller type is specified in `parameters.m`

`p.controller=1` : Passive (no input)

`p.controller=2` : Control via symmetry [1]

`p.controller=3` : Control via symmetry + passivity based control (PBC) [1]

`p.controller=4` : Feedback linearization [2]

`p.controller=5` : Energy pumping-and-damping [3]

Incline of slope can be changed by editing the `p.slope_change` within `parameters.m`
